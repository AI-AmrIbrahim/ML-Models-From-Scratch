# Machine Learning Model Implementations From Scratch

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning models from scratch. Each model is implemented as a Python function, and the implementations are tested using Jupyter notebooks. The goal is to demonstrate a clear understanding of machine learning algorithms by coding them without using high-level libraries like `scikit-learn` for the core implementations.

## Models Implemented

The following is a list of machine learning models that will be implemented. A checkmark will be added once a model is fully implemented and tested.
